#HELLO EVERYONE,
In the world of automation, imagine a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—not with buttons, but using hand gestures! 

This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to recognize hand gestures and convert them into numbers and operators, allowing you to perform calculations without touching anything! 

Features
✅ Hand gesture-based number & operator detection
✅ Performs Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/)
✅ Real-time video processing with OpenCV
✅ Auto-detection every 10 seconds (No need to press any keys)
✅ Displays the result on the screen and resets for new calculations

 Setup & Installation

Tech Stack
Python 
OpenCV (for video processing) 
MediaPipe (for hand tracking) 

👋 How to Use
First Number: Show 1-5 fingers to indicate a number. The system captures after 8 seconds.
Operator: Show hand gestures:
🖐️ (5 fingers) → +
✊ (fist) → -
✌️ (2 fingers) → /
🤟 (3 fingers) → *
Second Number: Show 1-5 fingers again.
Final Result Appears on Screen.
Wait 8 seconds → Auto-reset → Repeat from step 1.





Thank You Everyone For Watching :-)
